RK:
* NHibernate + ByteCode not checked in. 
I was thinking to wait until next release and then reference bins instead 
To run test, ref latest NH trunk and Castle Byte code
Apply patch NH-2355

* Only two test fixtures yet committed. PropertyAccessTest that works,
and FieldAccessTest that fails due to our code that only do reflection
on (public) properties at read/write
