    <title>About the project</title>
    <para> NHibernate Validator is a powerful and extensible framework to validate objects on the
        .Net Platform. Born as a port of <emphasis role="italic">Hibernate Validator
        3.0.0</emphasis> project at december of 2007. Later many improvements and changes were made
        to the Core and API, and now we can say that NHibernate Validator is more than a port.
        NHibernate Validator is entirely written in C#. The first release of NHibernate Validator
        was entirely developed by <emphasis role="italic">Dario Quintana</emphasis>, <emphasis
            role="italic">Gustavo Ringel</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">Fabio
        Maulo</emphasis>.</para>
