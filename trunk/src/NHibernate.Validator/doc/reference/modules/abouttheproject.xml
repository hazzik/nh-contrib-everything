    <title>About the project</title>
    <para>NHibernate Validator is a powerful and extensible framework to validate objects using the
        .Net Platform. Born as a port of <emphasis role="italic">Hibernate Validator
        3.0.0</emphasis> project at december of 2007. Later on, many improvements and changes were
        made to the Core and API, and now we can say that NHibernate Validator is more than just a
        port. NHibernate Validator is entirely written in C#. The first release of NHibernate
        Validator was entirely developed by <emphasis role="italic">Dario Quintana</emphasis>,
            <emphasis role="italic">Gustavo Ringel</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">Fabio
                Maulo</emphasis>. We appreciate the help of <emphasis role="italic">Davy Brion</emphasis>
        in the revision of this document.</para>
